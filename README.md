# My Basic Calculator

My Basic Calculator is a simple calculator project built in C, designed to handle basic arithmetic operations. The project applies compiler logic throughout its implementation, as part of the Compilator subject at university.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Command-line interface
- Demonstrates compiler concepts in C

## Project Motivation

This project aims to reinforce compiler theory by applying parsing and evaluation techniques to a basic calculator. It serves as a practical exercise for understanding how compilers process and execute expressions.
